You stand before the crumbling gates of Ebonwrath, a fortress swallowed by stone and silence. 
The air is heavy with dust and the faint stench of decay. Moss creeps along broken walls, and 
an ancient wooden door looms ahead, its iron hinges rusted but intact.


    How do you wish to continue?
          
    1) Push the door open with force.
    2) Examine the door carefully.
    3) Look around the ruins outside.
    4) Knock on the door.
